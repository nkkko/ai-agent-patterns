Glossary of Key Terms
Agent: In the context of AI, a system that can perceive its environment and take actions to achieve goals. Often characterised by autonomy, memory, and the ability to evolve.
Code Smells: Indicators in source code that suggest potential underlying problems in the design or implementation.
Context Window: The amount of text that a language model can process at one time, influencing its ability to understand and generate coherent responses based on a given input.
Cosine Similarity: A measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Often used to compare vector embeddings in vector databases.
Embedding (Vector Embedding): A numerical representation of data (text, images, etc.) in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships between different data points.
Eval Framework: A structured approach and set of tools used to assess the performance and quality of AI models and agents.
Feature Flags: Conditional statements in code that enable or disable certain features without deploying new code. Over time, they can lead to code bloat.
GRPO (Generative Recursive Policy Optimisation): A reinforcement learning method specifically designed for training LLM agents through iterative draft generation and evaluation.
Hallucination: In the context of language models, the generation of incorrect or nonsensical information that is not grounded in the provided context or training data.
KPI (Key Performance Indicator): A measurable value that demonstrates how effectively a company is achieving key business objectives.
LLM (Large Language Model): A deep learning model with a large number of parameters, trained on vast amounts of text data, capable of generating human-like text.
LLM-as-judge: Using a language model to evaluate the output of another language model or AI agent, often based on predefined criteria or rubrics.
MLE (Machine Learning Engineer): An engineering discipline that focuses on building, deploying, and maintaining machine learning systems.
Model Context Protocol (MCP): A protocol designed to standardise interactions between AI clients and servers, allowing clients to invoke server capabilities in a structured way.
Prompt Engineering: The process of designing and refining prompts (textual inputs) to elicit desired responses from language models.
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): An AI framework that combines the power of pre-trained language models with the ability to retrieve information from external knowledge sources to generate more accurate and context-aware responses.
React (Reason + Act): A technique for AI agents where the model reasons about the task and then takes an action (e.g., using a tool), iteratively refining its approach based on observations.
Refactoring: The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behaviour to improve readability, maintainability, and performance.
Reinforcement Learning (RL): A type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions in an environment.
Rubric Engineering: Designing structured data sections or rubrics for LLM drafts to facilitate reward verification and improve the reasoning process in agent training.
SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle): A process used by the software industry to design, develop, test, and deploy software applications.
Semantic Search: A search technique that aims to understand the meaning of search queries and documents, rather than relying solely on keywords.
System Prompt: Instructions given to a language model at the beginning of a conversation to set its persona, behaviour, or constraints.
Telemetry: The automated collection and transmission of data from remote sources for monitoring and analysis. In AI, this often includes tracing inputs, outputs, and performance metrics of agents and models.
Tracing: A form of telemetry that tracks the execution flow of a request through different components of a system, providing insights into performance and potential bottlenecks.
Vector Database: A type of database that stores data as vector embeddings, allowing for efficient similarity searches based on semantic meaning.
Verifier: In the context of reinforcement learning for LLM agents, a process or model used to check if a desired outcome or reward has been attained after an action or generated text.
