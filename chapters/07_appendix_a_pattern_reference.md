## Pattern Selection Guide

When deciding which patterns to apply in your agent system, consider:

1. **System complexity**: Simpler patterns for straightforward applications, more complex patterns for sophisticated systems
2. **Scalability requirements**: Patterns that support growth in functionality and performance
3. **Integration needs**: How the agent will interact with external tools and services
4. **Memory requirements**: The type and extent of information the agent needs to retain
5. **Collaboration scope**: Whether single-agent or multi-agent architecture is appropriate

Remember that patterns can be combined and adapted to meet your specific requirements. The most effective agent designs often involve the thoughtful integration of multiple complementary patterns.

## Using This Reference

This reference is designed to serve as a quick lookup resource during your agent development process. For more detailed explanations, implementation guidance, code examples, and considerations, refer to the respective chapters where each pattern is fully explored.

As the field of AI agent design continues to evolve, these patterns will form a foundation that can be extended and refined. We encourage you to adapt these patterns to your specific needs and contribute to the growing body of knowledge in agent-based system development.
