    "text": "# Diagram Linking Guidelines\n\n## Two Approaches for Including Diagrams\n\n### 1. Direct Embedding\nFor diagrams that are specific to a chapter and not reused elsewhere, embed the Mermaid code directly in the markdown:\n\n```markdown\nHere's a diagram showing the basic agent loop:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Start] --> B[Process Input]\n    B --> C[Generate Response]\n    C --> D[End]\n```\n```\n\n### 2. Reference External Diagram Files\nFor diagrams that might be reused or are complex:\n\n1. Create a dedicated Mermaid file in `images/mermaid/` with a descriptive name\n2. Include frontmatter with title and description\n3. Reference in chapters using the special syntax\n\n#### Example Mermaid File (images/mermaid/agent_loop.md):\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Agent Execution Loop\ndescription: Basic flow of an AI agent's execution cycle\n---\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Start] --> B[Process Input]\n    B --> C[Generate Response]\n    C --> D[End]\n```\n```\n\n#### Referencing in a chapter:\n```markdown\n![Agent Execution Loop](mdc:../images/mermaid/agent_loop.md)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Consistent Naming**: Use descriptive, lowercase filenames with underscores\n2. **Appropriate Placement**: Place diagrams immediately after their first mention\n3. **Captions**: Always provide descriptive captions for referenced diagrams\n4. **Size Control**: If a diagram is too large or complex, consider:\n   - Breaking it into multiple simpler diagrams\n   - Using a reference to an external file rather than direct embedding\n5. **Visual Consistency**: Ensure all diagrams follow the book's style guide\n\n## Diagram Checklist\n\n- [ ] Diagram uses appropriate type (flowchart, sequence, etc.) for the concept\n- [ ] Diagram follows the book's color scheme and style guidelines\n- [ ] Text is concise and clearly readable\n- [ ] Diagram is placed in appropriate context in the text\n- [ ] Complex diagrams are stored as separate files with proper references"

      "output": "You have two main options for adding diagrams to your chapter:\n\n### Option 1: Direct Embedding (for chapter-specific diagrams)\n\nInsert the Mermaid code directly in your markdown:\n\n```markdown\nThe following diagram illustrates the process:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    A[Input] --> B[Process]\n    B --> C[Output]\n```\n```\n\n### Option 2: External Reference (for reusable or complex diagrams)\n\n1. Create a file in `images/mermaid/` (e.g., `process_flow.md`)\n2. Add the diagram with proper frontmatter:\n   ```markdown\n   ---\n   title: Process Flow\n   description: Flow diagram showing the basic process steps\n   ---\n   \n   ```mermaid\n   flowchart TD\n       A[Input] --> B[Process]\n       B --> C[Output]\n   ```\n   ```\n\n3. Reference it in your chapter:\n   ```markdown\n   ![Process Flow](mdc:../images/mermaid/process_flow.md)\n   ```\n\nRemember to place diagrams immediately after their first mention in the text and ensure they follow the book's style guidelines."
