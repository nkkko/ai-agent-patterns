- **Status:** Draft
- **Estimated Length:** 5 pages

## Chapter Goals
- Help readers design effective multi-agent architectures
- Provide patterns for implementing reliable agent communication and coordination
- Explain how to balance autonomy and control in multi-agent systems

## Key Concepts
- Multi-agent system architecture
- Agent communication and coordination
- Task decomposition and assignment
- Specialized agent roles
- Result aggregation and consensus

## Patterns to Include
- **Orchestrator Pattern**
  - Description: A central agent that coordinates multiple specialized agents
  - Use case: Complex tasks requiring decomposition and specialized handling
  - Implementation considerations: Task routing, result aggregation, error handling

- **Peer Network Pattern**
  - Description: A network of agents that communicate directly with each other
  - Use case: Collaborative reasoning, debate, and consensus-building
  - Implementation considerations: Communication protocols, consensus mechanisms

- **Specialization Pattern**
  - Description: Creating agents with specialized capabilities for specific tasks
  - Use case: Efficiency through specialization, complex domain tasks
  - Implementation considerations: Interface consistency, expertise boundaries

- **Communication Protocol Pattern**
  - Description: Standardized formats for inter-agent communication
  - Use case: Any multi-agent system requiring reliable communication
  - Implementation considerations: Message format, error handling, state synchronization
