## Metadata
- **Chapter Number:** 1
- **Title:** Building Blocks of Software Agents
- **Created:** 2025-03-18
- **Last Updated:** 2025-03-18
- **Status:** Draft
- **Estimated Length:** 5 pages

## Chapter Goals
- Establish a common vocabulary for discussing agent architectures
- Provide software engineers with a clear mental model of agent architecture
- Introduce the essential elements needed to implement effective agent systems
- Help readers recognize architectural challenges specific to agent systems

## Key Concepts
- Agent architecture mental model
- Core components of modern LLM-powered agents
- The agent execution loop
- Architectural challenges specific to agent systems

## Patterns to Include
- **Agent Component Pattern**
  - Description: The fundamental components every agent needs
  - Use case: All agent development scenarios
  - Implementation considerations: Balancing complexity with capabilities

- **Agent Loop Pattern**
  - Description: The Observe → Think → Act cycle
  - Use case: Implementing the basic flow of agent operation
  - Implementation considerations: Context management and error handling

## Content Sections
1. **Agents vs. Traditional Applications**
   - LLMs as reasoning engines
   - Key differences in architecture requirements

2. **Core Agent Components**
   - Perception: How agents process inputs
   - Reasoning: LLM integration patterns
   - Action: Tool execution frameworks
   - Memory: State management approaches

3. **The Agent Loop**
   - Basic flow: Observe → Think → Act
   - Managing context throughout the loop
   - Error handling and recovery

4. **Evaluating Agent Architectures**
   - Reliability and robustness metrics
   - Extensibility considerations
   - Performance evaluation approaches

## Code Examples
- Example 1: Anatomy of a simple GitHub-integrated coding agent
- Example 2: Comparison of architectures: simple chat vs. autonomous agent

## Diagrams
- Diagram 1: Agent Loop Flowchart - Visualizes the Observe → Think → Act cycle
- Diagram 2: Agent Component Diagram - Shows how different agent components interact

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of LLMs (Large Language Models)
- General software engineering experience

## Related Chapters
- Introduction: Provides context for why agent design patterns matter
- Chapter 2: Core Architectural Patterns - Builds on the fundamental components

## Notes
- This chapter provides the foundation for all subsequent chapters
- Keep examples practical and directly applicable
- Use consistent terminology that will be used throughout the book
