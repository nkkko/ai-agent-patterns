# Chapter 2: Core Architectural Patterns - Specification

## Overview
This specification outlines the content, structure, and key concepts for Chapter 2 of "Agentic AI Design Patterns", focusing on foundational architectural patterns for agent systems.

## Metadata
- **Chapter Number:** 2
- **Title:** Core Architectural Patterns
- **Created:** 2025-03-18
- **Last Updated:** 2025-03-18
- **Status:** Draft
- **Estimated Length:** 7 pages

## Chapter Goals
- Help readers select the appropriate architectural pattern for specific agent requirements
- Explain the trade-offs between different architectural approaches
- Provide guidance on implementing chosen patterns with best practices

## Key Concepts
- Agent architecture as a determinant of capabilities and limitations
- Pattern selection based on requirements
- Trade-offs between simplicity and extensibility
- Implementation best practices for each pattern

## Patterns to Include
- **Monolithic Agent Pattern**
  - Description: A single, unified codebase handling all agent responsibilities
  - Use case: Simple agents with focused capabilities
  - Implementation considerations: Simplicity vs. future extensibility

- **Protocol-Based Agent Pattern**
  - Description: Agents that communicate with tools through standardized protocols
  - Use case: Extensible agents with diverse tool needs
  - Implementation considerations: Protocol design, tool discovery, maintenance

- **Multi-Tier Agent Pattern**
  - Description: Separation of agent responsibilities into distinct layers
  - Use case: Complex agents with specialized processing needs
  - Implementation considerations: Interface design, communication between layers

- **Event-Driven Agent Pattern**
  - Description: Agents designed to respond to asynchronous events
  - Use case: Agents operating in highly dynamic environments
  - Implementation considerations: Event handling, state management

## Content Sections
1. **Monolithic Agent Pattern**
   - Structure and implementation
   - When to use: Simple agents with focused capabilities
   - Code example: Basic implementation structure
   - Key considerations and limitations

2. **Protocol-Based Agent Pattern**
   - Structure and implementation
   - When to use: Extensible agents with diverse tool needs
   - MCP and other integration protocols
   - Code example: Implementing protocol-based tool discovery

3. **Multi-Tier Agent Pattern**
   - Structure and implementation
   - When to use: Complex agents with specialized processing needs
   - Code example: Separating reasoning from execution
   - Key considerations and limitations

4. **Event-Driven Agent Pattern**
   - Structure and implementation
   - When to use: Agents responding to asynchronous events
   - Code example: Event handling implementation
   - Key considerations and limitations

## Code Examples
- Example 1: Single-purpose vs. multi-purpose agent architecture comparison
- Example 2: Case study: Refactoring from monolithic to protocol-based architecture

## Diagrams
- Diagram 1: Monolithic Agent Architecture - Shows all components in a single structure
- Diagram 2: Protocol-Based Architecture - Illustrates how agents and tools communicate via protocols
- Diagram 3: Multi-Tier Architecture - Depicts the separation of concerns into different layers
- Diagram 4: Event-Driven Architecture - Shows event flow and handling

## Prerequisites
- Chapter 1: Building Blocks of Software Agents
- Understanding of basic design patterns in software engineering

## Related Chapters
- Chapter 1: Building Blocks of Software Agents - Provides the foundation for these architectural patterns
- Chapter 3: Tool Integration Patterns - Will build on these architectural approaches
- Chapter 4: Memory and State Patterns - Will address state management within these architectures

## Notes
- Include clear decision criteria for when to use each pattern
- Provide realistic trade-offs rather than presenting any pattern as universally superior
- Focus on implementation details that are practical for immediate use
- Address how to evolve from simpler to more complex architectures as needs change
